# Hackathon_GDS
The problem statement given was for the big data domain. All we had to do is to write the script to generate mock data upto 10 - 15k and perform some processing on that data and then, finally store that processed data into any noSQL database here say Cassandra. Here, we have 2 sample data in json file format and 2 slowly changing dimension data that are created in AWS Redshift.
